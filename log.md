**Hisako:**
- Head movement: engage your core

**Shani:**
- Elastico: land with feet in plie and weight centered
- Elastico: when exiting, bring your chest up last (similar concept to "body roll" out of chicote)

**Freddy/Andressa:**
- Counterbalance: stretch/reach with extended leg
- Basic footwork: you should be pushing off your back foot (not "reaching" with the forward foot)
- Basics: Be precise about your directions
- Head movement: generally have your head over the shoulder over the foot that is stepping

**Petra:**
- Basics: keep weight/energy forward, not falling backwards
- Roast chicken: don't necessarily need to have your head follow your hand (leave it behind, more lamba style)

**Gui:**
- Bodyroll (connection): roll into a bit of a counterbalanced, amplitude based on where the lead's hand is
- Arm (styling): keep engaged even when not needed in the arm movement
- Basics: keep steps more level, not so much lowering/lunging, also keep energy moving forward after turns
- Basics: don't put heel down for the first chick
- Boomerang: preferred to end with last step crossed in front (adidas pant leg)
- Boomerang: don't rush steps, keep stepping to music so really step with the balls of your feet
- Opening out: settle slowly on the ball of your foot/don't land too quickly
- Opening out: lead may lead you to close like a lateral and not always in opened position
- Yo-yo: when wrapping into cuddle position, don't have space between arm and body
- Yo-yo: when released from yo-yo, free arm sooner so it doesn't collide with lead

**Walter Fernandes:**
- Keep core engaged, rib-cage closed.
- Step with foot turned out for lateral.
- When swiveling, close thighs together (engaged).
- When engaged in head movement, head should be a bit more back and not tilted on the side immediately.
